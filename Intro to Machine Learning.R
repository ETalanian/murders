#Y = Outcomes
#X's (X1 - Xp) = Features (or predictors, or covariates)

#Prediction problems can be Categorical or Continuous
#For Categorical outcomes, Y can be any of k classes
#ie k in a digit reader = 10 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0)
#ie k in speach detection = All posisble words
#ie k in a spam filter = 2 (Spam | Not Spam)
#in this course, k = 1 through K, and binary k = 0,1
#When the outcome is categorical, we refer to the machine-learning task as classification.
#our predictions will be categorical, just like our outcomes, and they will either be correct or incorrect.
#when the outcome is continuous, we'll refer to the task as prediction, which will be measured in error, instead of right/wrong.
